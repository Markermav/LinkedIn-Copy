## 1. Project Description

### Problem Statement
The lack of an efficient Career Services Platform hampers the job-seeking process for students and employers alike. Existing solutions lack a centralized platform for students to create portfolios and for employers to post job openings. Moreover, existing portals often lack robust features to filter postings according to user requirements. This inefficiency impacts job hunting and recruitment processes for both candidates and employers.

### Project Definition
The objective is to develop a middle-fidelity prototype of a comprehensive Career Services Platform addressing these challenges. This platform will facilitate effective job matching, serving the needs of students and employers. It will enable students to create/update portfolios and allow employers to post job openings. An admin will manage user profiles, postings, and tracking.

### Project Overview
CareerCampus aims to provide a user-centered platform offering tools and assistance to manage and improve careers. Services include resume creation, networking opportunities, career resources, and mentorship programs. By fostering relationships and facilitating skill development, it serves students, employers, and industry professionals. It serves as a centralized platform for career enhancement, providing a user-friendly interface and functionalities.

### Project Scope
The project includes end-to-end development of CareerCampus, including front-end, back-end components, database management, and external system integration. The platform supports multiple user roles (students, employers, admin, trainers) with specific roles and access levels. Core features include job ad postings, job searching, management, tracking, and interview scheduling. Responsive design principles ensure accessibility across devices and browsers. Data privacy and security are paramount, complying with relevant regulations. Agile project management allows for iterative development, frequent feedback, and continuous improvement.
